**Personal Learnings:**
This was my first project using React Native and building for both iOS and Android native apps. Having used ReactJS for WebApps, learning the differences between the two and the advantages and disadvantages were more clear and understood. A really great intro project into working with native apps and I, now feel confident in my ablities to develop using React Native.
